Face identification system is a complex image-processing problem in real world applications with complex  effects  of  illumination,  occlusion,  and  imaging  condition  on  the  live  images. It  is  a combination  of  face  detection  and  identification  techniques  in  image  analyzes.  Identification application is used to find position of the faces in a given image. Identification algorithm is used to classify given images with known structured properties, which are used commonly in most of the computer vision applications

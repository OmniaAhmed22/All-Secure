Face identification system is a complex image-processing problem in real world applications with complex  effects  of  illumination,  occlusion,  and  imaging  condition  on  the  live  images. It  is  a combination  of  face  detection  and  identification  techniques  in  image  analyzes.  Identification application is used to find position of the faces in a given image. Identification algorithm is used to classify given images with known structured properties, which are used commonly in most of the computer vision applications

This app will be based on image processing to open a door when it recognizes someone particularly.
It will be a combination of hardware and software as we will use Arduino, camera and servo-motor for the door.
We will use Python, OpenCV  and other libraries if we need that.
